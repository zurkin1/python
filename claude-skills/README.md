# Claude Code skills

Personal skills synced across machines via this repo, since Claude Code loads skills from a local folder per machine rather than an account-wide store.

## Setup on a new machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurkin1/Python.git
cp -r Python/claude-skills/*/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

(On Windows: `~/.claude/skills` is `C:\Users\<you>\.claude\skills`.)

## Keeping in sync

Skills are edited directly under `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` day to day. To publish a change here:

```bash
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/pdf-to-epub claude-skills/
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/i-have-adhd claude-skills/
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/fix-docx claude-skills/
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/md-fixup claude-skills/
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/txt-to-epub claude-skills/
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/txt-to-md claude-skills/
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/pdf-rtl-page-direction claude-skills/
git add claude-skills && git commit -m "Update skills" && git push
```

Then on the other machine: `git pull` and copy again.

## Contents

- **pdf-to-epub** — convert a PDF book to EPUB, or fix an existing EPUB's scroll/paging direction (RTL-aware).
- **i-have-adhd** — output-formatting style for ADHD-friendly responses (`/i-have-adhd`).
- **fix-docx** — diagnose and fix slow-opening/saving `.docx` files bloated by PDF-to-Word conversion.
- **md-fixup** — clean up a PDF-extracted/OCR'd book's markdown into readable, well-structured text (RTL-aware).
- **txt-to-epub** — convert a plain-text/markdown/docx/pdf book into a clean EPUB with chapter structure and RTL support.
- **txt-to-md** — convert a markdown book specifically into a clean EPUB (chapters, metadata, images, RTL). Despite the name, input must already be `.md` — use txt-to-epub for other source formats.
- **pdf-rtl-page-direction** — fix a PDF whose two-page/spread view shows pages in the wrong order (missing `ViewerPreferences/Direction` = `/R2L`) for a Hebrew/Arabic book.
